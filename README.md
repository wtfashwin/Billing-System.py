# Billing-System.py
Made a billing system using python. 

Here are the key points and features of the billing system project:
Graphical User Interface (GUI): The program is built using the tkinter library, providing a user-friendly GUI.
Billing Software Title:The software's title is displayed at the top using a Label.
Customer Details: Customer name and phone number can be entered in the GUI. A unique bill number is generated automatically.
Product Categories: The products are categorized into three main sections: Medical, Grocery, and Cold Drinks.
Product Entry:For each product, there's an input field to specify the quantity.
Price Calculation: The program calculates the total price for each category (Medical, Grocery, Cold Drinks).
It also calculates the tax for each category and the overall total bill.
Bill Area Display: A text area is used to display the selected products, their quantities, and prices.
The bill area displays the itemized bill with a clear format.
Buttons for Functionality: "Total" calculates the total bill.
"Generate Bill" displays the bill in the text area.
"Clear" resets all the inputs and bill.
"Exit" allows the user to exit the program.
Data Persistence: The program allows users to save bills as text files for future reference.
Users can also search for and display previous bills.
Error Handling:  The program provides error messages for missing customer details or empty bills.
Random Bill Number: A random bill number is generated for each transaction.
Modularity: The code is structured with functions to improve readability and maintainability.
File Handling: The program saves and retrieves bills from the "bills" directory.
Exit Confirmation: The program asks for confirmation before exiting to prevent accidental closure.
